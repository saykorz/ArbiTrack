<h3>🧠 Summary (explained like I’m 5)</h3>
<p>Imagine you have a bunch of magical wallets that get surprise coins. This app shows you:<br>
🎁 which wallet got what,<br>
🧾 what it paid for,<br>
📤 where it uploaded files,<br>
💰 how much you made,<br>
😱 and if you owe the tax man.</p>
<p>It’s like a fun chart where you can see all your crypto money moving around!</p>

<h3>📝 Description</h3>
<p>Crypto users often have many wallets. Tracking their income, spending, and taxes across them is chaotic. In the Arbitrum network, users receive ANT tokens for various tasks, but there’s no easy way to see:<br>
- who got how much<br>
- what they spent it on<br>
- where file upload payments happened.</p>

<p>This app solves that. It aggregates multiple wallet addresses and shows you daily insights like:<br>
📅 income & expenses by day<br>
💸 current value vs received value<br>
📉📈 profit/loss based on token prices<br>
🧾 estimated taxes owed</p>

<p>All data is stored in a decentralized database in the Autonomi network, keeping it secure and censorship-resistant.</p>
